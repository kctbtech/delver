    Skara Brae is an archaelogical site in Orkney.
    It is the remains of a Neolithic village.
    There are eight houses in Skara Brae, which have low passageways that connect them. All of the houses are made with stone with only one room in each of them. The contain furniture like beds and dressers. These houses were most probably inhabited between the years 3200BC and 220BC.
    Evidence has recently been found, that shows it was inhabited for about 600 years before the last people moved from Skara Brae towards the beginning of the Bronze Age.
  </p>
  <p>
    Skara Brae was rediscovered in 1850. It was rediscovered almost by accident, during a very strong storm. Sand, earth and plants that were covering the houses were wiped away by the strong storm.  The storm was able to reveal the outlines of Skara Brae. After further digging, archaeologists uncovered the settlement.

  <p>
    Skara Brae is a very important archaeological finding due to its high amounts of great preservation and the excellent condition of it. Due to the great preservation, the houses still have furniture inside of them. The main reason why Skara Brae is important, is because it gives a deep insight into communities of the Neolithic period.

    Along with that, the inhabitants were skilled craftspeople. This is because jewerelly and handmade bowls were discovered.
