    At about 800BC, British people started learning how to use iron. Due to this, there was a dramatic impact on everday life. Iron tools made farming very easy than before and settlements grew in size.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iron Age Britain was quite a violent place. Many people would live in clans. These clans belonged to tribes, and those tribes were led by warrior kings. Rival tribes would usually fight with very deadly iron weapons. Many people would live in hill forts to keep safe from any attacks.

    During the Iron Age, the Celtics spread out across Europe and many started to settle in Britain. Ancient Britons followed a Celtic way of life. They would usually produce fine metalwork. They also enjoyed feasting, music and poetry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Towards the end of the Iron Age, people started to live in hill forts. These forts would be surrounded by walls and ditches. Warriors defended their people from enemy attacks from these forts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside the hill forts, families lived in round houses. They were usually only one-roomed homes and had a pointed thatched roof. Walls were made from wattle and daub (mixtures of mud and twigs). In the centre of these round houses was a fire. They were used to cook meals. There was also a cauldron. Around the walls were jars. These stored food. Beds were made from straw covered with animal skins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iron age farmers grew crops and vegetables. They had geese, goats and pigs and also had herds of cows and many flocks of sheep. Some people worked as potters, carpenters and metalworkers. Most men and boys trained to be warriors. They had to be prepared to fight at any time.

    Many tools were used in Iron age times.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Rotary Quern: The rotary quern was used to grind grain into flour. It was made out of two flat stones. One was placed on top of the other. Grain would be poured into a hole in the upper stone. The top stone would then be turned by a handle. Because the lower stone did not move, the grain would be crushed between the two stones. Because of the rotary quern, grinding flour was much quicker and easier than before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iron-making tools: Iron age blacksmiths would make strong swords by heating a bar of iron with a charcoal fire. When iron was white-hot, the smith would rest the bar on an anvil. He hammered it into shape before it cooled. Smiths worked with tongs and hammers and they also used metal flies to smooth off rough edges from the finished sword.
  </p>
  <p>
    Potter's Wheel: British people used potter's wheels at the end of the Iron Age. They would use their feet to turn the wheel. As the wheel turned, the potters would use their hands to shape the clay. The use of this wheel meant that people could make pots of any shape and size.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iron-tipped plough: Iron Age ploughs were sometimes called 'ards'. They were usually made from wood. They had an iron tip on the end of the plough to help it cut through heavy soil. The plough would be guided by the farmer and would also be pulled by an oxen. Farmers would no longer need to u se antlers and stone tools to dig up their land.
  </p>
  <p>
    Loom: Weavers hung long threads from a tall loom made from wood. Vertical threads (known as the warp) were weighted down using stones. Weavers used a wooden tool called a shuttle to pass a different thread (the weft) between the vertical threads. Celtic weavers used natural dyes to colour their threads. They produced brightly-coloured cloth with bold patterns of checks and stripes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pole lathe: Wood-turners used a pole lathe, so they could shape pieces of wood into dishes, bowls or plates. Wood would be fixed onto a wooden pole. This was turned by a rope. The rope would be attached to a foot pedal so the wood-turner could use his foot to turn the pole. As the piece of wood turned, the turned used an iron knife to shave it into shape.

    People in Iron Age Britain had many strong beliefs in powerful spirits. Because of this belief, they met to worship the spirits in sacred places. For example: the shores of a lake or a clearing in a wood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Priests (known as druids) would lead religious ceremonies. They would sacrifice animals and would sometimes sacrifice humans! Druids gave precious offerings, such as swords and cups, to the spirits. They would bury any offerings in the ground or throw them into rivers, lakes and bogs. When Romans first arrived in Britain, they wrote about the religion of the ancient Britains. They described four of their main festivals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imbolc was held in February to welcome the birth of the first lambs. Beltane was celebrated in May, when the cattle were moved to their summer fields. Lugnassad was held in August to celebrate the ripening of the crops. Samhain took place in November and marked the end of the year.
