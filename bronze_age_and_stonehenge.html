    Before Stonehenge, there were four or five pits around where it is. The pits were all held by what seem to be totem-pole like posts. Such posts were most probably erected in the Mesolithic period, between 8500 and 7000BC. It is yet to be known how the posts relate to Stonehenge as we know it today.
  </p>
  <p>
    During 8500 and 7000BC, most of southern England was covered by woodland. The chalk downland, near to Stonehenge, was most probably an open landscape. This is why it has become a site of an early Neolithic monument complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    The complex included the enclosure at Robin Hood's Ball. Those were two cursus monuments, which were placed on rectangular earthworks, and several long barrows. These dated from the centuries around the year 3500BC. The placement of these monuments and their location were most probably what influenced the later location of Stonehenge.

    It is possible that features such as the Heel Stone and the low mound, known as the North Barrow, were early components of Stonehenge. The most early major event to of been known to have happened, was the construction of a circular ditch with an inner and outer bank. This was built about 3000BC. This enclosed an area about 100m in diameter, and had two entrances. This was a very early form of the henge monument.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the bank and ditch were possibly timber structures. These structures were set inside the bank of 56 pits. These were known as the Aubrey Holes. There has lately been lots of debate as to what stood in these holes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Within and around the Aubrey Holes, and also int he ditch, people buried cremations. 64 of these cremations have been found, and an estimated amount of 150 individuals were buried at Stonehenge. This made it the largest Neolithic cemetery in the British isles.

    It was about 2500BC, that the stones set up the centre of the monument. There were two types of stone, that were primarily used to make Stonehenge. These were large sarsens and the smaller 'bluestones'. Sarsens were erected in two concentric arrangements - this means an inner horseshow and an outer circle. The bluestones were set up between them in a double arc.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the stones were being set up in the centre of the monument, the sarsens close to the entrance were raised, together with hte four Station Stones on the periphery.
  </p>
  <p>
    200 or 300 years later, the central bluestones were rearranged to form circle, along with and inner oval. This was later altered to form a horseshoe. The Earthwork Avenue was also built at this time. The point in the Avenue was to connect Stonehenge with the river Avon.

    One of the last prehistoric activities at Stonehenge was the digging around the stone setting of two rings of concentric pits. This was most probably for a rearrangement of the stones. This was never completed though.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stone settings of Stonehenge were built at a time of great change in prehistory. New styles of Beaker pottery and the knowledge of metalworking, also along with a transition to the burial of individuals with their goods, were arriving from the Continent. From about 2400BC, well-furnished Beaker graves such as that of the Amesbury Archer, were found nearby.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the early Bronze Age, a concentration of round barrows in Britain were build in the area around Stonehenge. These barrow groups were deliberately located on hilltops visible from Stonehenge itself. This is only how it seems to appear however. Such barrow groups included those on King Barrow Ridge and the rich burials at the Normanton Down Cemetery.

    From the middle Bronze Age, less effort was put into the construction of the ceremonial monuments such as Stonehenge and more effort was put into activites including the creation of fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the Iron age, a major hillfort, which was later known as Vespasian's Camp, was constructed one and a quarter miles east of Stonehenge. It overlooked the river Avon, and was most probably constructed at about 700BC. Stonehenge appears to be frequently visited in the Roman period (most likely from 43AD). We believe this because many Roman objects had been found there. recent excavations raised the possibility that it was a place of high ritual importance to the Roman-British people.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is believed that the town of Amesbury was likely to have been established around the 6th century AD. A decapitated man, who was possibly a criminal, was buried at Stonehenge in the Saxon period. From this time on, sheep husbandry dominated hte open downland around Stonehenge. The earliest surviving written references to Stonehenge, date from the medieval period, and from the 14th century AD and onwards, there was an increase in references to Stonehenge. Along with that, drawings and paintings of Stonehenge became a thing.

    Ever since 1897, vast tracts of land on Salisbury Plain were bought by the Ministry of Defence. This was for army training exercises and activites of the military. This did have an impoact on the area. Barracks, firing ranges, field hospitals, airfields and light railways were established. Some of these, such as the First World War Stonehenge airfield, have long since been demolished. However, others like the Larkhill airfield sheds, still stand and are important to the history of early military aviation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, turnpike roads and the railway to Salisbury were introduced and brought many more visitors to Stonehenge. From the 1880s, various stones had been propped up with timber poles. Concerns for the safety visitors grew however, when an outer sarsen upright and its lintel fell in 1900. Sir Edmund Antrobus, the then owner of Stonehenge, with the help of the Society of Antiquaries, organised the re-erection of the leaning tallest trilithon in 1901.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was the start of a sequence of campaigns to conserve and restore Stonehenge. In 1964, the last stones were consolidated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The monument remained in private ownership until 1918. This was when Cecil Chubb, a local man who had purchased Stonehenge from the Atrobus family at an auction three years previously, gave it to the nation. The duty to conserve the monument fell to the state, because of that.
  </p>
  <p>
    From 1927, the National Trust began to acquire the land around Stonehenge. This was to preserve and restore it to grassland. Large areas of the Stonehenge Landscape are now in their ownership. More recent improvements (such improvements include the removal of the old visitor facilities and hte closure of the section of the old A344 that ran close to the stones) have begun the process of returning Stonehenge to an open grassland setting. However, more can be done than just that. English      Heritage has welcomed a government plan to invest in a tunnel. This would remove much of the busy A303 and help reconnect the monument to its ancient landscape.
