    Julius Caesar was born in Subura, Rome in 100BC. He was born to an aristocratic family that could trace bloodlines back to the founding of Rome. In terms of Roman Standards, his parents were not that rich. Julius Caesar's full name was Gaius Julius Caesar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caesar started his education at around the age of 6. He was taught by a private tutor, that tutor being Marcus Antonius Gnipho. From this tutor, he learned how to read and write. He also learned about Roman law and how to speak in public. These would be important skills for when we became the leader of Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caesar's father sadly died when he was 16 years old. Because of this, Caesar became the head of his family and also became responsible for his mother Aurelia, along with his sister, Julia. At age 17, he married Cornelia. She was the daghter of a powerful politician in Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Young Caesar soon found himself in the middle of a power struggle between two factions in the government. The current dictator of Rome, Sulla, became enemies with both Caesar's uncle Marius and Caesar's father-in-law Cinna. Because of that, Caesar joined the army and left Rome in order to avoid Sulla and his allies.

  <p>
    When Sulla died, Caesar returned back to Rome. He was a military hero due to his years in the army. He was soon able to quickly rise up the ranks in the government. Along with that, he made allies with many powrful men, including: Pompey the Great and the wealthy Crassus. Caesar was an excellent speaker and due to this skill, the people of rome loved him.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the age of 40, Julius Caesar was elected to consul. Consul was the highest possible ranking position in the Roman Republic. The consul, if put in modern perspective, is quite like a president or a figure similar to that. There were two consuls and they only served for one year. At the end of Caesars time of being a consul, he became a governor in the province of Gaul.
  </p>
  <p>
    As governor of Gaul, Caesar was able to take charge of four Roman legions. He was very effective as a governor and general. He conquered all of Gaul. He also gained respect and honour from his army and soon was considered alongside pompey as the greatest general in the Roman army.

  <p>
    Politics in Rome was becoming very hostile whilst Caesar was in Gaul. Many of the leaders were jealous of Caesar and his following. Even one of Caesars allies, Pompey, became jealous. Soon, Caesar and Pompey became rivals. Caesar had the support of the people and Pompey had the support of the aristocrats.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caesar announced that he was going to return to Rome and run for consul again. The Senate of Rome replied he must give up the command of his army first. Caesar refuesd and because of that the Senate called him a traitor. Caesar began marching his army into Rome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Caesar then took control of Rome in 49BC and spent the next 18 months fighting against Pompey. He then defeated Pompey. He chased him all the way to Egypt. When he reached Egypt, the young Pharaoh, Ptolemy VIII,  had Pompey killed and presented his head to Caesar as a gift.
  </p>
  <p>
    3 years later, in 46BC, Caesar returned to Rome. He was now the most powerful man in the whole world. The Senate made him dictator for life and he ruled like a king. Many changes were made to Rome. He put his own supporters in the Senate. He also built new buildings and temples in the city of Rome. He even changed the calendar to the now famous Julian calendar with 365 days and a leap year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some peoople in Rome started to feel that Caesar was perhaps a bit too powerful. Because of this, they became worried his rule would put an end to the Roman Republic. So, they plotted to kill him. The leaders of the plot were Cassius and Brutus. On March 15, 44BC, Caesar entered the Senate. A number of men ran up t him and began to attack him. They then killed him. It is estimated that he was stabbed 23 times
